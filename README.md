ember-flows-generator
=====================

Easily build complicated route traversal patterns in Ember.


Reasoning
---------

In a directed graph there are two possible representations: an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list. [ember-flows](https://github.com/nathanhammond/ember-flows) uses an adjacency list. However, manually generating the adjacency list for your application is tedious and prone to error.


Implementation
--------------

This is an Ember application which you can use to generate flows for your Ember application.


Building
--------

```
npm install -g bower ember-cli
git clone git@github.com:nathanhammond/ember-flows-generator.git
cd ember-flows-generator
./install.sh
```
