ember-flows-generator
=====================

Easily build complicated route traversal patterns in Ember.


Reasoning
---------

In a directed graph there are two possible representations: an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list. ember-flows uses an adjacency list. However, manually generating the adjacency list for your application is tedious and prone to error.


Implementation
--------------

This is an Ember application which you can use to generate flows for your Ember application.
